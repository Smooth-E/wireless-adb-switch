This release brings several quality of life features and some bug fixes. Here is the list:

- Add option to automatically enable wireless debugging on boot
- Add option to disable widget updates (in case you do not have any widgets or if you need better battery life)
- Add option to copy connection data without syncing it through KDE Connect
- State on the settings screen that KDE Connect integration requires root privileges
- Use translucent activity for widget configuration to show wallpapers on the background. WADBS no longer requires the storage permission!
- Notify user about missing privileges when trying to configure a widget
